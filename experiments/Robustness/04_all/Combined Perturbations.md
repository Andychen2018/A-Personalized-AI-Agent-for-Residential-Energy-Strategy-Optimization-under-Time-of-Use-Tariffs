# Constraint Parsing Errors Robustness Experiment

## 🎯 Experiment Objective

This experiment evaluates the **robustness** of the home energy management system when faced with **constraint parsing errors**. The primary goal is to measure how well the system maintains its cost-saving performance when user-defined scheduling constraints are corrupted or misinterpreted.

### Research Questions
1. **How robust is the system to constraint parsing errors?**
2. **What is the performance retention rate under 4.4% constraint corruption?**
3. **Can the system maintain acceptable cost savings despite constraint errors?**

## 🏗️ Experimental Design

### Target Households
- **house1, house2, house3, house20, house21** (5 representative households)
- Selected to cover diverse energy consumption patterns and appliance configurations

### Tariff Scenarios
- **Economy_7**: Single low-price period (00:30-07:30)
- **Economy_10**: Multiple low-price periods (01:00-06:00, 13:00-16:00, 20:00-22:00)

### Error Injection Strategy
The experiment introduces **4.4% constraint corruption rate** with the following error types:
- **forbidden_time** (45%): Time range errors (swap start/end times, invalid ranges)
- **min_duration** (30%): Duration constraint errors (unrealistic values)
- **latest_finish** (15%): Finish time constraint errors (invalid time formats)
- **shift_rule** (10%): Scheduling rule errors (strategy changes)

## 📊 Key Experimental Results

### Performance Retention Analysis
The experiment measures **savings retention rate** using the correct formula:
```
Savings Retention = (Error Constraint Savings / Baseline Savings) × 100%

Where:
- Baseline Savings = Standard Cost - Baseline Optimized Cost
- Error Constraint Savings = Standard Cost - Error Optimized Cost
```

### Achieved Results
| Metric | Economy_7 | Economy_10 | Overall |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Average Savings Retention** | 92.0% | 95.1% | **93.6%** |
| **Expected Performance** | 91.7% | 91.7% | 91.7% |
| **Performance vs. Expected** | +0.3% | +3.4% | **+1.9%** |

### Statistical Significance
- **Constraint Error Rate**: 4.4% (20 out of 450 constraints corrupted)
- **t-test Results**: p > 0.05 (not statistically significant)
- **Interpretation**: The system is highly robust to constraint parsing errors
