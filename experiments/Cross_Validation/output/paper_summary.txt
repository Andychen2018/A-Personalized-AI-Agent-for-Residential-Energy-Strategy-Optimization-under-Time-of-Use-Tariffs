Using 5-fold temporal cross-validation (training on 4 months, testing on 1 month),
the system achieves consistent performance across different seasonal patterns with
coefficient of variation < 0.15 for cost savings metrics (CV = 0.082).

Detailed seasonal analysis reveals that:
- winter months (December-February) show 10.1% ± 6.8% average cost savings
- spring months (March-May) show 9.9% ± 5.9% average cost savings
- summer months (June-August) show 9.1% ± 5.4% average cost savings
- autumn months (September-November) show 9.0% ± 6.4% average cost savings

The variation is primarily attributed to different appliance usage patterns and
seasonal constraint preferences. Overall system performance demonstrates
9.6% ± 0.8%
cost savings with high stability (CV = 0.082).
